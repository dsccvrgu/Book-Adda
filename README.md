<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a web based application to search for books using keywords and fetch details. The application has a simple UI but it is intended to have a more user friendly UI.

Here's why:
* This project will help you to improve your basic understanding of react application development, API, json and creating logic for applications. 
* It will also help you learn how to build an effective UI/UX for your own projects.
* The tech stack used is very beginner friendly.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

The tech stacks used in the projects are :
* [REACT.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Google books APIs](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)
